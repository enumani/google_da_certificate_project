The Scoop
Lily Moreno, Cyclistic's marketing guru, threw us a challenge: find out what makes casual riders and annual members tick. The goal? Cook up a genius marketing plan that turns those casual cruisers into loyal, card-carrying members.

Meet Cyclistic
Imagine a bike wonderlandâ€”5,800 bikes, 600 docking stations, and a variety of rides from recliners to tricycles. Cyclistic is the go-to for Chicago's bike enthusiasts, from leisurely rollers to daily road warriors.

What's the Plan?
We're digging deep into Cyclistic's trip history to uncover the secrets of casual riders and annual members. How do they pedal? What motivates them? What's their favorite route? All this detective work is for one purpose: crafting a killer marketing strategy.

Why Annual Memberships Matter
Word on the street (and the boardroom) is that annual members are the real MVPs for Cyclistic's bottom line. The mission? Convince more folks to make the leap from casual joyrides to committed memberships.
